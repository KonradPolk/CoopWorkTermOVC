      <h2>Abstract / Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        During the Fall 2025 work term, I completed a four-month co-op placement as an
        OVC Website Training & Support Specialist at the University of Guelph&rsquo;s Ontario
        Veterinary College (OVC). In this role, I supported faculty and staff by
        troubleshooting SharePoint and CampusPress issues, maintaining intranet
        content, and building Power Automate workflows to support internal processes
        across the college.

        This website documents the skills and experience I gained through that work,
        with a focus on practical problem-solving, automation, and user support in a
        large academic environment. The work term pushed me to apply computing concepts
        outside of coursework and take responsibility for systems used daily by faculty
        and staff.

      <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
      <p>
        The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) is one of Canada&rsquo;s leading veterinary
        education and research institutions and is part of the University of Guelph,
        where I study. OVC supports a large and diverse community of faculty, staff,
        and students, with a strong focus on teaching, research, and clinical practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a computing perspective, OVC relies heavily on Microsoft 365 tools,
        particularly SharePoint, to support internal communication, websites, and
        documentation. The intranet team supports faculty onboarding, maintains
        content, and helps users resolve technical issues related to these platforms.

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>Microsoft 365 Proficiency</h3>
          <p>
            At the start of the work term, my goal was to become comfortable using core
            Microsoft 365 tools such as Excel, Power Automate, Teams, and Forms in a
            professional setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I achieved this by applying these tools in daily tasks, building and
            maintaining Power Automate flows, and asking for feedback from my supervisors
            and teammates. By the end of the term, I was able to complete tasks using
            these tools with minimal guidance and improved efficiency.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>Faculty Onboarding Support</h3>
          <p>
            Supporting faculty onboarding to the OVC intranet was an important part of
            my role. I shadowed onboarding sessions, guided faculty through required
            steps, and documented common issues to reduce repeated questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience improved my ability to explain technical processes clearly
            and helped me understand how small usability issues can significantly affect
            user experience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>SharePoint and CampusPress Troubleshooting</h3>
          <p>
            I strengthened my troubleshooting skills by assisting with SharePoint and
            CampusPress support requests. This involved identifying issues, testing
            possible fixes, and explaining solutions in non-technical language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, I became more confident resolving issues independently and
            communicating clearly with users who had limited technical backgrounds.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>Teamwork and Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Working as part of the intranet support team required clear communication,
            reliability, and adaptability. I participated in team meetings, shared
            updates on my work, and supported teammates when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helped me better understand team workflows and how individual
            contributions fit into larger projects.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>Problem-Solving and Time Management</h3>
          <p>
            Balancing multiple support requests and projects required strong
            organizational skills. I learned to prioritize tasks, track progress, and
            ask for clarification when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of the term, I was more comfortable managing my workload
            independently and approaching problems methodically rather than reactively.

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>
        As an OVC Website Training & Support Specialist Co-op Student, I supported
        faculty and staff with website-related tools used across the Ontario Veterinary
        College. This included troubleshooting SharePoint and CampusPress issues,
        maintaining intranet content, and assisting with faculty onboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large part of my role involved creating, maintaining, and fixing Power
        Automate flows. I reviewed failed flows step by step to identify errors and
        restore functionality. One project involved converting BMP images of shipment
        slips into searchable HTML files for the accounting team.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        This work term gave me hands-on experience supporting real users in a
        professional environment. I gained confidence troubleshooting live systems,
        working independently, and communicating clearly with faculty and staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this experience strengthened my technical foundation and gave me a
        clearer understanding of how computing support functions within a large
        academic institution.

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to thank the OVC intranet team for their guidance and support throughout my work term. I am especially grateful to Scott Schau and Scott Moccia for their leadership, mentorship, and trust in my work. Their willingness to involve me in real tasks, provide clear direction, and offer thoughtful feedback helped me build confidence and understand how my work fit into the broader goals of the team. Learning from their experience gave me valuable insight into how effective technical leadership works in a professional environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would also like to thank Martie Torre for being an incredibly kind and supportive teammate. She was always approachable and willing to help, whether I had a technical question or needed clarification on a process. Her patience and encouragement made it easier to ask questions and learn from mistakes, and she played a big role in making the work environment welcoming and collaborative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I am thankful for the opportunity to learn from such a supportive team and to contribute to the work being done at the Ontario Veterinary College.
