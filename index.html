    <section>
      <h2>Abstract / Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        During the Fall 2025 work term, I completed a four-month co-op placement as an
        OVC Website Training & Support Specialist Co-op Student at the University of
        Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College (OVC). This role provided hands-on exposure
        to website support, faculty onboarding, and the use of enterprise tools within
        a large academic institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to reflect on the technical, professional, and
        communication skills I developed throughout my work term, as well as how these
        experiences contributed to my growth as a computing student preparing for
        future co-op and professional roles. This work term helped bridge the gap
        between academic coursework and real-world computing support in a complex,
        user-focused environment.

      <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
      <p>
        The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) is one of Canada’s leading veterinary
        education and research institutions and is part of the University of Guelph,
        where I study. OVC supports a large and diverse community of faculty, staff,
        and students, with a strong focus on teaching, research, and clinical practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a computing perspective, OVC makes extensive use of Microsoft 365 tools,
        particularly SharePoint, to support internal communication, websites, and
        documentation across the college. The team I worked with focuses on helping
        faculty use these tools effectively, maintaining intranet content, and
        supporting onboarding for new staff. Working in this environment allowed me
        to see firsthand how computing solutions support day-to-day academic operations
        for users with varying levels of technical experience.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop practical proficiency in Microsoft 365 tools such as Excel, Power Automate, Teams, and Forms</li>
        <li>Support faculty onboarding to the OVC intranet in an effective and user-friendly manner</li>
        <li>Strengthen troubleshooting and communication skills related to SharePoint and CampusPress support</li>
        <li>Collaborate effectively as part of a professional support team</li>
        <li>Develop professional problem-solving, time management, and organizational skills</li>

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>
        As an OVC Website Training & Support Specialist Co-op Student, I supported
        faculty and staff at the University of Guelph with website-related tools used
        across the Ontario Veterinary College. This included troubleshooting issues
        in SharePoint and CampusPress, maintaining intranet content, and assisting
        with faculty onboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large part of my role involved creating, maintaining, and fixing Power
        Automate flows used for internal OVC processes. When flows failed, I reviewed
        them step by step to locate errors and restore functionality. In some cases,
        I met directly with OVC staff, including the accounting team, to design new
        automations based on their workflow needs. One project involved creating a
        flow that converted BMP images of shipment slips into HTML files so the
        contents could be searched, since BMP images could not be indexed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside automation work, I handled smaller support tasks such as helping
        professors with CourseLink (D2L) issues and responding to general support
        requests. This role required balancing technical problem-solving with clear
        communication, especially when working with users who did not have technical
        backgrounds. Most of my learning came from handling real support cases and
        working through problems with my team, rather than from prior coursework alone.

      <h2>Example Project</h2>
      <p>
        Below is an example Power Automate flow similar to those I worked on during
        my co-op term.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        This work term at the Ontario Veterinary College gave me practical experience
        supporting real users in a professional environment. I worked with enterprise
        tools such as SharePoint and Power Automate, gained experience troubleshooting
        live systems, and became more comfortable handling support requests independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the start of the term, I am now more confident identifying issues,
        fixing them without step-by-step guidance, and communicating solutions clearly
        to faculty and staff. If someone were asked to describe this website, I would
        want them to see clear evidence of hands-on experience, skill development, and
        an improved understanding of how computing support functions in a large academic
        institution.
      </p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to thank the OVC intranet team for their guidance and support
        throughout my work term. I am especially grateful to Martie Torre, Scott Schau,
        and Scott Moccia for their mentorship and willingness to share their knowledge.
        Their feedback helped me improve both technically and professionally, and I
        appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the Ontario Veterinary College in
        a supportive team environment.
